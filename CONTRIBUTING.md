* The [master](https://github.com/pvmiguel/SpanishAcquisitionIQC/tree/master) branch is reserved for synchronizing with
  the parent fork of this repository. Pull requests to this branch should originate from this repository's 
  [parent's master branch](https://github.com/kayghar/SpanishAcquisitionIQC).
  
* Send all pull requests to the [CoryDev](https://github.com/pvmiguel/SpanishAcquisitionIQC/tree/CoryDev) branch

* If the PR is fixing a particular issue, please indicate that with a reference to the particular issue. For instance, if fixing
  issue #1, title the PR ```Fixes #1: Added loop and timing control```.
  
* Try to keep branches limited to working on one topic.

* Merge early, merge often! Big PRs can take a long time to review and are more prone to merge conflicts.

* Feel free to provide constructive criticism on any PR or issue. The more eyeballs we have on the code, the better!
